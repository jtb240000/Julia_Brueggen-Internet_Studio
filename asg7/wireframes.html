    <h2>Reading questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</li>
        <p>In the short term, sketching can be a lot faster than using online tools because it can be used immediately; there 
		are less distractions/obstacles during the process. It also has a lot of flexibility, being open to whatever the 
		designer is capable of, not just what the software is capable of. However, its benefits slow down in the long term 
		because it's not as easy to just rearrange elements; they have to be redrawn. It also doesn't have a way to display 
		interaction like animations or behavior, and it isn't conducive to collaboration. </p>
        <li>Which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why?</li>
        <p>I think using an online software to wireframe would work best for me because I can be indecisive, and online tools
		make it easier to rearrange elements and change details, and even save different versions to go back and try 
		different things. </p>
      </ul>
