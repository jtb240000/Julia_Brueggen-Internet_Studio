		<h2>Domain Name Ideas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>bunnyeatcarrot.info</li>
				<p>A completely irrelevant name that might be memorable. Makes you think of a little bunny eating a carrot 
				which is super cute. </p>
			<li>rethinkrecycling.info</li>
				<p>Straight to the point and a little clever with the alliteration. Not sure if it sounds demanding or 
				explorative. </p>
			<li>therecyclingreality.com</li>
				<p>Sounds more like a news report exposing something. Feels a little more flashy and intense. Also might be 
				misread. </p>
			<li>everydayeco.info</li>
				<p>idk</p>
		</ul>

		<h2>Making the Decision</h2>
			<h3>The Discussion</h3>
				<p>I began the discussion by introducing my ideas and my thoughts about each one. He immediately decided "rethinkrecycling.info" sounded the best, and it was also the option that I was leaning towards the 
				most. Still, we went through each option and evaluated them. He thought "bunnyeatcarrot.info" was a silly option, but it was cute. He thought "rethinkrecycling.info" was a very suitable name for exactly what 
				my website is, though it might not be exactly the right tone for the subtlety I want my website to have, which is similar to my concern that it might sound demanding. </p>
			<h3>The Chosen Name</h3>
