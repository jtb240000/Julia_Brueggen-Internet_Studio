		<h2>Domain Name Ideas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>bunnyeatcarrot.info</li>
				<p>A completely irrelevant name that might be memorable. Makes you think of a little bunny eating a carrot 
				which is super cute. </p>
			<li>rethinkrecycling.info</li>
				<p>Straight to the point and a little clever with the alliteration. Not sure if it sounds demanding or 
				explorative. </p>
			<li>therecyclingreality.com</li>
				<p>Sounds more like a news report exposing something. Feels a little more flashy and intense. Also might be 
				misread. </p>
			<li>everydayeco.info</li>
				<p>idk</p>
		</ul>

		<h2>Making the Decision</h2>
			<h3>The Discussion</h3>
				<p>I began the discussion by introducing my ideas and my thoughts about each one. He immediately decided "rethinkrecycling.info" sounded the best, and it was also the option that I was leaning towards the 
				most. Still, we went through each option and evaluated them. He thought "bunnyeatcarrot.info" was a silly option, but it was cute. He thought "rethinkrecycling.info" was a very suitable name for exactly what 
				my website is, though it might not be exactly the right tone for the subtlety I want my website to have, which is similar to my concern that it might sound demanding. He agreed that 
				"therecyclingreality.com" sounds more like a news site and he said that claiming to have the "reality" might not be the best approach, although it does match with the purpose of the site to inform about the 
				reality of a situation. Finally, he thought "everydayeco.info" sounded really cool but didn't quite match the topic of the site, which is specifically about recycling and not just general eco-friendliness. </p>
			<h3>The Chosen Name</h3>
				<p>In conclusion, the name we both agreed would be best is "rethinkrecycling.info". Even after considering the other options, this one still just sounded like the correct choice for my exact goal with my 
				website. It efficiently communicates the main topic and purpose of the website, and is a catchy name. </p>
