		<h1>Six Thinking Hats activity</h1>
			<h2>Thinking through the Six Hats</h2>
				<h3>White Hat</h3>
					<p>Because the website itself will be very information-heavy, I will need to actually find all that 
					information. I will need to find objective, unbiased sources of information that I can faithfully cite. 
					I will have to be mindful because there can be a lot of manipulated and intentionally persuasive 
					information with some other agenda when it comes to sustainability information. </p>
				<h3>Red Hat</h3>
					<p>There are some feelings of precaution about this project because we feel that people may be 
					distrustful about the information they learn, and a lot of people already have different ideas of what 
					sustainability looks like. When appealing to the audience we need to focus on gaining trust. </p>
				<h3>Black Hat</h3>
					<p>People already have ideas of what sustainability should look like and we don't want to fall under the 
					narrative of people feeling like they're being forced to constantly change what they're doing. My 
					website's ideas can be disagreeable to some people if they feel like they're being forced to change 
					how they already do things. Maybe I could reconsider the role recycling eductation plays in the 
					narrative I'm pushing - does it distract from the main message? To what extent is it necessary for 
					helping the audience arrive at the conclusion?</p>
				<h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
					<p>Using images that appeal to the user's emotions can be effective for influencing the user without it 
					feeling too manipulative or forced. We like the framework of acknowledging and leaning into the 
					assumptions people already have; the framework of debunking myths and pursuing truth is a good way to 
					address competition. We like the focus on objective facts, presenting options without pressure, and 
					letting the user come to the conclusion on their own, instead of pushing recommendations that people 
					might find challenging to realistically implement in their lives. </p>
				<h3>Green Hat</h3>
					<p>Some possible new ideas are using examples of innovative companies, which might help the user feel 
					more inspired and hopeful, and give them more of an idea of how to apply the lessons. The other idea was 
					using images that appeal to user emotions, as a persuasive tool that relies more on the user making up 
					their own mind on how to feel, instead of telling them what to think. </p>
				<h3>Blue Hat</h3>
					<p>When having these discussions we should try not to get distracted. Focus on professionalism and take 
					break when goals have been reached. The problem being addressed with this project is lack of knowledge 
					on realistic sustainable practices for consumers, especially middle class consumers who may not have the 
					means to make a big impact, but do have the means to make different choices about what they buy. We need 
					to explore how to best address this problem with an educational website. </p>
