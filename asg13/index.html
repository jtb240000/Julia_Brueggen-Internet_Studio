  <h1>Assignment 13: Careers Web Page</h1>
  <h2>Finding my Dream Job</h2>
  <p>What would be an ideal job for me, based on my interests and abilities? I don't have a solid idea of what I want my 
  future career to be, but I do know I am currently interested in many aspects of the ATEC program at UTD, especially media 
  studies. I like analyzing and writing about film and animated media. Some other interests I'm pursuing in the ATEC program 
  are design and animation production. I've really enjoyed learning how to make web pages in this class and now I want to 
  make my own website that I can personalize and use to showcase all my interests. The skills I've learned in this class are 
  really useful and maybe they will be part of my future career in some way. On the topic of coding, I also took an 
  introductory class to programming this semester, where I learned how to code in Python. That has kind of been part of me 
  pursuing business analytics as well, though I'm still not really sure what business analytics actually is. </p>
