  <h1>Assignment 13: Careers Web Page</h1>
  <h2>Finding my Dream Job</h2>
  <p>What would be an ideal job for me, based on my interests and abilities? I don't have a solid idea of what I want my 
  future career to be, but I do know I am currently interested in many aspects of the ATEC program at UTD, especially media 
  studies. I like analyzing and writing about film and animated media. Some other interests I'm pursuing in the ATEC program 
  are design and animation production. I've really enjoyed learning how to make web pages in this class and now I want to 
  make my own website that I can personalize and use to showcase all my interests. The skills I've learned in this class are 
  really useful and maybe they will be part of my future career in some way. On the topic of coding, I also took an 
  introductory class to programming this semester, where I learned how to code in Python. That has kind of been part of me 
  pursuing business analytics as well, though I'm still not really sure what business analytics actually is. </p>
  <h2>Finding 3 jobs that might be a good fit for me</h2>

      <h3>Web and Graphics Designer</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.monster.com/job-openings/web-and-graphics-designer-coppell-tx--38d6c383-7701-4d51-b0d4-885f1c786271?sid=e32e1124-42cc-4464-b116-5703884d9e27&jvo=m..p-jthsj.">job listing</a></p>
      <p>This job would be great because it would utilize more than one of my skills/interests. I would get to use my 
      creativity and knowledge of design principles to create graphics. I would also be using tools that I am experienced 
      with, which are Adobe Creative Suite and HTML and CSS for web design. I haven't heard of the company UWorld before, but 
      it seems like a good company; they provide resources to help students learn. To improve my chances of having a job like 
      this in the future, I should build up my portfolio so I can demonstrate my abilities with design. I think this job 
      aligns really closely with where I'll be when I complete my degree at UTD. </p>

      <h3>Graphic Design Intern</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.monster.com/job-openings/graphic-design-intern-dallas-tx--4f787d06-1153-43c8-aca2-43fc96bb59ed?sid=dd9d83f7-bc2b-4b7b-a3f2-b8624188b664&jvo=m..p-jthsj.4">job listing</a></p>
      <p>This job would be a great first step for me to move up in the industry. I would be able to use my design skills and 
      I meet a lot of the qualifications, which are proficiency in Adobe Suite and Microsoft Office. The listing also 
      mentions that "Being adept at animation and video editing is a significant plus" so I think that could really work in 
      my favor. The company TruePoint Communications is another company I haven't heard of before, but it seems like a really 
      good company to help me move up in the industry, so it would be a great choice to be an intern at. This company serves 
      clients with branding, so higher roles within this company would be a great fit for me. </p>
