      <ul>
        <li>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</li>
        <p>Structured content defined and describes the relationships between pieces of content data on a page, and has been 
          used for years. Semantic HTML is markup that communicates information about the meaningful relationships 
          between document elements. Beyond simply describing how content should look on screen, semantic HTML communicates 
          information about this content to algorithms and software agents. </p>
        <li>How do they work together?</li>
        <p>Structured content provides a base for additional semantic data to be built on. </p>
        <li>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</li>
        <p>Structured content and semantic HTML make a web page and the information on it more accessible and accurate for 
          users who will engage with it in many different ways, especially if they are engaging with the information through 
          something like a search engine results page or a digital assistant. </p>
