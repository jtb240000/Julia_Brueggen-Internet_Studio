<h1>Spider-Man</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Consistencies across different publications</h3>
<p>The character of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> has appeared in many publications, beginning with comics in the 1960s and then going on 
to appear in animated and live-action series and films. Despite these many different iterations, he remains a distinct character with a consistent backstory and values.</p>
<p>Spider-Man is a young hero whose secret identity is Peter Parker, raised by his aunt May in Queens. He received superpowers from a radioactive spider bite. His powers 
include agility and a "spider-sense" and he uses a spiderweb material for combat and mobility. He wears a red costume which makes him recognizable while also concealing his 
identity.</p>
<p>Spider-Man's values are based on the concept, "With great power comes great responsibility," which is typically told to him by his Uncle Ben before he dies. These words, 
combined with Spider-Man's trauma/loss, push him to use his powers for good and protect the people he loves. Spider-Man often makes sacrifices in his personal life to 
prioritize his responsibility as a hero.</p>
