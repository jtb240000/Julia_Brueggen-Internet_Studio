	<h1>Assignment 11: Flexbox Dodgeball Team</h1>
		<h2>My Dodgeball Team</h2>
			<p>This is my dodgeball team. The team name is chocolate pie cup because who wouldn't love a cup of chocolate 
			pie. We are a team that is determined to win and committed to fair play and sportsmanship. Come and root for us 
			at our next games as we move up in the tournament. </p>

					<h3>Bunny</h3>
					<img src=./images/bunny.jpg>
					<p>This cute little bunny would be a great addition to the team because it is super cute. Who doesn't 
					love a cute little bunny. It also eats a carrot. Carrots are good for the little bunny. </p>

					<h3>Dog</h3>
					<img src=./images/dawg.jpg>
					<p>This dog is super strong and tough. He would definitely do whatever it takes to support his team 
					members. He is not very good at dodging around the balls, but he is very loyal to his teammates and is 
					willing to make sacrifices to help them stay in the game. </p>

					<h3>Minecraft Bryce</h3>
					<img src=./images/mcbryce.png>
					<p>Minecraft Bryce is fairly athletic and is good at games. The only problem is, he is only experienced 
					with working with cubes, not spheres. But maybe that will give him a natural inclination to avoid the 
					balls. </p>
				</div>
				<div class=item>
					<h3>Me</h3>
					<img src=./images/me.jpg>
					<p>I would be good at dodgeball because I would just be so tiny that the other team can't see me. Also, 
					the other team will probably not expect me to be very good at the game. I was going to say they'd be 
					underestimating me but that may not be the case. </p>
				</div>
				<div class=item>
					<h3>Turkey</h3>
					<img src=./images/turkey.png>
					<p>This turkey is very elusive, so the balls will probably not be able to find him. He also can be very 
					powerful on offense too. Overall just a capable and aggressive player to have on the team. </p>
