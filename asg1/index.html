	  <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
	  <h3>Critical Web Design Ch. 0: Introduction</h3>
	  <h3>Evolution of the Web</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>The history of the web we know today can be categorized into three phases - Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0</li>
		    <ul>
			  <li>Web 1.0</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>~1995</li>
				  <li><strong>"read-only web"</strong> - websites were informational, static, and were linked together by hyperlinks</li>
				  <li>text-only e-mails could be written and sent</li>
				  <li><strong>"content delivery network (CDN)"</strong> - users passively received the information shown on websites without interacting with it</li>
				</ul>
			  <li>Web 2.0</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>~2005</li>
				  <li><strong>"read-write web" / "participative social web"</strong> - growth in user interaction</li>
				  <li>blogging, social networking, music/video streaming, etc.</li>
				  <li><strong>"Web as Platform"</strong> - software applications are built upon the web</li>
				  <li>Application Programming Interface/APIs - allow applications to communicate with each other</li>
				</ul>
			  <li>Web 3.0</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>~2018</li>
				  <li><strong>"executable web" / "read-write-execute web"</strong> - dynamic applications, interactive services, “machine-to-machine” interaction, sharing of data</li>
				  <li><strong>"Semantic Web"</strong> - </li>
					<ul>
					  <li>AI and Machine Learning - machines process content in a human-like way, data is connected and understood contextually and conceptually</li>
					  <li>semantic metadata guides searches, affecting user experience</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		  <li>The future may hold a more universal, convenient, and decentralized web, with more secure data ownership and compensation for individuals.</li>
		</ul>
	  <h3>The Wax and Wane of the Web</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>the web is constantly changing</li>
		  <li>designers and developers continue to learn to keep up with new standards</li>
		  <li>old standards like HTML are essential because they continue to be supported as evolution happens</li>
		  <li>it's important to optimize for performance and accessibility for the user, design with care, and explore beyond what's the most convenient</li>
		</ul>
