	  <h2>Three Things Learned from the Reading Material</h2>
		<ol>
		  <li>For most of the history of the web, its evolution involved becoming more <strong>interactive</strong>, between developers and users, and between different applications.</li>
		  <li>In recent years, the web's evolution has involved becoming more <strong>intuitive</strong>, with machine learning, semantic metadata and the way AI can process and define content.</li>
		  <li>HTML is a standard that continues to be valuable throughout the web's constant change.</li>
		</ol>
	  <h2>Idea for Semester Project</h2>
		<p>For my semester project I would like to make a website that provides information about how recycling works and how to reduce environmental impact. My website could investigate how impactful common "sustainable" practices really are, possibly turning focus towards the role individuals play as consumers. Ultimately I would want my website to help people find more practical and accessible lifestyle changes other than just recycling.</p>

	  <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
	  <h3>Critical Web Design Ch. 0: Introduction</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>"critical design"</strong>challenges assumptions about existing designs by asking questions. Critical web design takes into account things like user experience and accessibility.</li>
		  <li>critical web design works to reveal qualities of human-computer interaction, also uncovering injustices or discrimination</li>
		  <li>critical web design can be found online and is intended to be functional and accessible. it involves interfaces/experiences like <strong>internet art</strong>, new approaches and ways of thinking.</li>
		</ul>
	  <h3>Evolution of the Web</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>The history of the web we know today can be categorized into three phases - Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0</li>
		    <ul>
			  <li>Web 1.0</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>~1995</li>
				  <li><strong>"read-only web"</strong> - websites were informational, static, and were linked together by hyperlinks</li>
				  <li>text-only e-mails could be written and sent</li>
				  <li><strong>"content delivery network (CDN)"</strong> - users passively received the information shown on websites without interacting with it</li>
				</ul>
			  <li>Web 2.0</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>~2005</li>
				  <li><strong>"read-write web" / "participative social web"</strong> - growth in user interaction</li>
				  <li>blogging, social networking, music/video streaming, etc.</li>
				  <li><strong>"Web as Platform"</strong> - software applications are built upon the web</li>
				  <li>Application Programming Interface/APIs - allow applications to communicate with each other</li>
				</ul>
			  <li>Web 3.0</li>
				<ul>
				  <li>~2018</li>
				  <li><strong>"executable web" / "read-write-execute web"</strong> - dynamic applications, interactive services, “machine-to-machine” interaction, sharing of data</li>
				  <li><strong>"Semantic Web"</strong> - </li>
					<ul>
					  <li>AI and Machine Learning - machines process content in a human-like way, data is connected and understood contextually and conceptually</li>
					  <li>semantic metadata guides searches, affecting user experience</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		  <li>The future may hold a more universal, convenient, and decentralized web, with more secure data ownership and compensation for individuals.</li>
		</ul>
	  <h3>The Wax and Wane of the Web</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>the web is constantly changing</li>
		  <li>designers and developers continue to learn to keep up with new standards</li>
		  <li>old standards like HTML are essential because they continue to be supported as evolution happens</li>
		  <li>it's important to optimize for performance and accessibility for the user, design with care, and explore beyond what's the most convenient</li>
		</ul>
