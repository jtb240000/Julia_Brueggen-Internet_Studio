	<h1>Assignment 12: Favorite Movies Gallery</h1>
		<p>The reason these are my favorite movies is because they are the best movies. It's not just my opinion, it's just a fact. I know what the best movies are. Anyways, I do see some trends with them. Most of them 
		are from the late 1980s and 1990s which is pretty weird. I guess those decades just had the best movies. Also, a good number of them are about World War 2. I guess that is a really good topic for movies to be 
		about. Two of them have Tom Hanks playing the main character, which is a pretty significant portion since there's only 12 of them, so I guess he's just a really good actor. 1/3 of them are animated, which I think 
		is a proper portion. Animated movies are great and I consider them to be on the same level as live-action films. The last thing I notice is that almost all of them are American films. This kind of makes sense 
		because historically the United States has simply made the most movies, but could also be a reflection of the range of movies I've seen. Since I'm American I've seen a lot of American Films. I will concede that 
		this may be an obstacle to my ability to discern which movies are objectively the best. So although there may be some missing, all of these movies do still deserve to be on this list. </p>

				<h3>Grave of the Fireflies (1988)</h3>
				<p>Two kids in Japan during World War 2 and it doesn't end well :( also it's not just a sad movie about two kids, it's also a metaphor for Japan's role in the war and a criticism of Japanese youth in the
