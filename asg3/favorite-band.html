	<h2>About The Beatles</h2>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles" target="_blank">The Beatles</a> were an English rock band active in the 1960s. They are known for their innovative style and had a huge influence on the music industry and 
		youth culture in the 1960s. Their band was made up of four members, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The Beatles are my favorite band because I just like a lot of their songs. They were super popular and released a lot of music and experimented with many different music styles, so it's very easy to be a fan of them. 
	Some of my favorite songs by them are All My Loving, And I Love Her, I'm Looking Through You, and Let it Be.</p>
