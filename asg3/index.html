	<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
		<h2>Reading Questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable 
				elements are not obvious).</li>
				<p><a href=https://www.utdallas.edu/>UTD website</a> - headings like "news" and "campus features" just look like 
				titles for sections on the webpage, not obviously links that can take the user to a unique page with more about 
				that section. </p>
			<li>From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story 
				format help you refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.</li>
				<p>Framing a project in a story format can help designers stay grouded in what they are creating. It helps them 
				single out the themes that they should focus on and gives them a path to follow that is more memorable and 
				engaging. It brings the opportunity for more human connection, because people are more inclined to resonate with 
				a story than with something they just see as a product. Products/services that are based in story are more 
				memorable and meaningful as an experience to users. By framing my website design project in a story format, I 
				can better connect with the persona of my audience and create something that feels more meaningful. </p>
			<li>From Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography: What are different ways to establish hierarchy 
				(or emphasis) in typography design? Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy.</li>
				<p>Hierarchy can be established by adding different levels of emphasis to guide the viewer's eye to different parts of 
				the page in an intentional order. Emphasis can be added by increasing size and weight, using eye-catching colors or 
				styles, or placement. <a href=https://www.apple.com/>The Apple website</a> adds emphasis to their product names that 
				they want people to buy by raising the size and weight and using black text on white background or white text on black 
				background. This shows that the most important part of the page that they want viewers to look at first is the newest 
				products. Other text on the page uses gray color in a smaller size so it is lower on the hierarchy. This is an 
				effective use of hierarchy because they are able to guide the viewer's eye to what is most important to them. </p>
