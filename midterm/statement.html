	<h1>Design Statement</h1>
	<p>My inspiration for the visual style of this project is the image of a simple red brick house. I made the background a 
	dark brick red sort of color and made that the dominant color of the website. I made the text an ivory color because I 
	wanted it to stand well from the dark background, but I also wanted it to give more warmth than just a normal white, 
	because the house should have a cozy feeling. I made the navigation panel and the footer feel like separate sections by 
	using different colors, so the main content of the page feels more framed at the top and bottom. I made the buttons and 
	links and contact form have a darker red background to have a consistent sign for the user for what they can interact 
	with on the site. For the typefaces, I wanted to find typefaces that had a homey feel to them. I used a handwritten 
	style typeface for the h1 headings to be more decorative, and a more simple serif typeface for the rest of the content, 
	so it would be easier to read and all be cohesive. I used the default serif browser font for the footer because I wanted 
	it to just feel basic and not be as noticeable as the rest of the page. </p>
